# HCI Zotero Redesign

Our CS4474 project is a rework of Zotero, a bibliography and research manager. The app allows you to group and add citations for easy management.

The app is built using React and Vite, and utitlizes the Ant Design component library.


To run app:
```
#in the main directory
npm install
npm run dev
```
