# HCI Zotero Redesign

Our CS4474 project is a rework of Zotero, a bibliography and research manager. The app allows you to group and add citations for easy management.

The app is built using React and Vite, and utitlizes the Ant Design component library.


To run app:
```
Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en

#in the main directory
npm install
npm run dev

In your browser go to http://localhost:5173/

From there add a folder by clicking the add folder button on the left side of the screen
Open the folder you've just created in the left-side menu
For demo purposes under the first folder you've added, under My Publications some pre-generated sources will be available for you to view and interact with
Once you've added a folder you will have the option to add subfolders or utilize the existing ones.
Inside these subfolders, you can add sources by clicking the add source button, delete sources by clicking the delete button attached to the source
and edit sources by clicking on the desired source and editing its data that appears on the right side of the screen.

Subfolders and main folders you create can be deleted.
```
